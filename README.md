# Magiador
Isometric Magic Brawl made with Unity and C#.


This one was the final project from the game dev course I took 3 years ago in the UTN (Nacional Technologic University). 
I used GutHub Desktop to manage the commits, but it was linked with gitlab instead, so for practical purposes i'm re-uploading it in here.
